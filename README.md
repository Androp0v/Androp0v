### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Physics student currently on the last year before graduation. I do a lot of scientific programming (simulations and statistical modeling) and Data Sciende in Python. I also work on mobile developement, having native Swift iOS apps (+macOS, thanks to Catalyst), native Java Android apps and multiplatform React Native projects. My scientific background has also pushed me into the realm of high performance computing: Metal shaders for accelerated GPU computations and Numba additions to existing Python projects to optimize their execution time.

On the personal side, I also work on 2D games using Unity and C#.
