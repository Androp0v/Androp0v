### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Physics student currently on the last year before graduation. Experienced in the field of numerical simulations and statistical modeling in scientific applications in Python. I also work on mobile developement, having native Swift iOS apps (now also in macOS, thanks to Catalyst), native Java Android apps and multiplatform React Native projects. My scientific background has also pushed me into the realm of high performance computing: Metal shaders for accelerated GPU computations and Numba additions to existing Python projects to optimize their execution time.

On the personal side, I also work on 2D games using Unity and C#.
