### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Physics BSc. Experienced in the field of numerical simulations and statistical modeling in scientific applications in Python. I also work on mobile developement, having native iOS apps in Swift (now also in macOS, thanks to Catalyst) and native Android apps in Java. My scientific background has also pushed me into the realm of high performance computing: Metal shaders for accelerated GPU computations and Numba additions to existing Python projects to optimize their execution time.

On the personal side, I also work on 2D games using Unity and C#.
